### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Fernando Araoz

I'm a student of systems engineering at the Universidad Nacional de San Agustin, Arequipa, PerÃº.
I enjoy bulding software for the web and learning about new and weird programming languages.

## Main Projects

### [Advent Of Code ðŸŽ¯](https://github.com/Araozu/JAdvent21)

I'm solving all the puzzles of Advent of code with Java!

### KScript/Misti ðŸ§ 

It's a programming language I'm creating for fun. It will be (hopefully) released one day.

### [Horarios Unsa ðŸ“š](https://horarios.araozu.dev)

A simple web page that help students of the Universidad Nacional de San Agustin to choose and organize
their courses. It has gone through many rewrites, including pure JS, Vuejs, Solidjs and maybe Reactjs in the future.

## Other projects

Over the years I've worked in many other projects for fun, testing new ideas, and university. I'm proficient with web technologies (Vue, React, Typescript) and Java/Kotlin.
