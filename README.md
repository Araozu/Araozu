### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Fernando Araoz

I'm a student of systems engineering at the Universidad Nacional de San Agustin, Arequipa, PerÃº.
I enjoy bulding software for the web and learning about new and weird programming languages.

## Main Projects

### [AdventOfCode 2020 ðŸŽ¯](https://github.com/Araozu/AdventOfCode2020)

I'm solving all the puzzles of Advent of code 2020 with many languages:
**C#, Kotlin, Elixir, F#**

### [KScript ðŸ§ ](https://kscript.araozu.dev)

This is the compiler for a new programming language that I made. It takes KScript code as input,
and gives JavaScript + source maps as output! The compiler is built with **TypeScript**.

It also has a web page that contains documentation, as well as an simple code editor.
Built with **Vue.js, Pug, JS, CoffeeScript and Sass**

### [Horarios Unsa ðŸ“š](https://horarios.araozu.dev)

A simple web page that help students of the Universidad Nacional de San Agustin to choose and organize
their courses. It is built with **Vue and TypeScript**

### [RiMaJon ðŸŽ²](https://rimajonv.araozu.dev/)

This is a card game inspired by Mahjong made for the web. The backend is built with **Kotlin**
and the frontend uses **Vue**.
